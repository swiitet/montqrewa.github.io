Choosing the dog as your pet (especially dog) may solving your health problems, such as <mark>psychological</mark> diseases, <mark>cardiovascular</mark> diseases and so on.

Today, our subject is heart. First analysis of data from the [Kardiozive Brno 2030 study](https://www.fnusa-icrc.org/en/research/research-groups/clinical-research/multidisciplinary-research/kardiovize-brno-2030) says owning a pet (specifically dog) may help maintain a healthy heart.The [results are interesting](https://mcpiqojournal.org/article/S2542-4548(19)30088-8/fulltext).

The study first generated baseline health and socio-economic information on more than 2,000 subjects in the Brno, Czech Republic, from January 2013 to Dec. 2014. In the following 2030 it was planned at intervals of up to five years.

In the 2019, the study looked at 1,769 subjects with no history of heart disease and scored them based on [Life's Simple 7](https://www.heart.org/en/professional/workplace-health/lifes-simple-7) ideal health behaviors and factors, as outlined by the American Heart Association: body mass index, diet, physical activity, smoking status, blood pressure, blood glucose and total cholesterol.

Overall, the study compared the cardiovascular health scores of pet owners with non-pet owners. He then compared the dog owners with other pet owners and those with no pets.

"In general, people who owned any pet were more likely to report more physical activity, better diet and blood sugar at ideal level," says Andrea Maugeri, Ph.D., a researcher with the International Clinical Research Center at St. Anne's University Hospital in Brno and the University of Catania in Catania, Italy. "The greatest benefits from having a pet were for those who owned a dog, independent of their age, sex and education level."

The study findings support the idea that humans can adopt, save, or buy an animal as a potential strategy to improve their cardiovascular health, as long as pet ownership provides a more physically active lifestyle, Dr. Maugeri says.
